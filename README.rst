nmrtools (version 0.1 pre-alpha)
================================

The goal of the nmrtools project is to create and distribute a Python library for the simulation of solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.

The project is inspired by the program `WINDNMR <https://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/plt/windnmr.htm>`_ by Hans Reich. The initial goal for the nmrtools package is to provide the tools needed to perform the same types of calculations that WINDNMR did--first- and second-order simulation of spin-1/2 spin systems, plus simulation of some dynamic NMR (DNMR) lineshapes. A longer-term goal is to expand the toolset (e.g. allow higher-spin nuclei, or new DNMR models).

The repository will hold additional material such as notebooks, exploratory code, and other random materials, as the project is hammered into shape.
