Notes on potential speed optimizations.

Considerations:
- By far the slow step for large spin systems is the eigensolution of the dense Hamiltonian.
  Sparse eigensolutions a) don't give all eigenvectors, and b) aren't performant.

- CuPy at this time requires CUDA, so no gains for macOS. However, it looks like PyTorch and Tensorflow can use M1.

- Numpy may also have some acceleration on new macs, as well as Tensorflow and PyTorch:
