Disclaimer: the author is neither an NMR spectroscopist, nor a software
engineer. I'm figuring this out as I go along. I welcome feedback on the
project. If you think the application or the code could be improved upon, feel
free to leave an issue on GitHub, or contact me by email (my last name at udel dot edu).
